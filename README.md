# E-commerce Back End

## Description

The intention of this project is to build the back end api routes for an e-commerce application. 

The goal here is to be able to set up 3 unique routes that allow you to submit POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE requests
to the backend api. Each of these requests interface and update a database on MySQL. One will be able to submit requests to categories, products, and tags in order to control their system.
